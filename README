        Returns a user object corresponding to the provided "id" or
        "username".

    "search_project( HASH )"

        'jobs'
            Names of job categories from the available list on
            Freelancer.com (Perl, XML, AJAX, et cetera.). This key accepts
            an array reference.

            For example:

                'jobs' => [
                              'Perl',
                              'XML',
                              'AJAX',
                          ]

        'featured'

            non-gold members' projects.

        'nonpublic'
            If 1, only nonpublic projects, else if 0, only public projects.

            Only projects ending sooner than "bidding_ends" days.

        'order'
            Order projects in the result output. Accepts a hash reference
            with keys and values corresponding to order criteria:

            'id'
                Order by project ID.

            'submitdate'
                Order by date when project was added (default).

            'state'

                Order by budget.

            'relevance'
                Order by relevance of search by keyword. This criterion
                should be used with the parameter "keyword".

                Order randomly.
